Pukul Lalat is *the* electronic game of my youth. My family received it from a
friend when I was five years old. We had intense competitions in our household,
as everybody tried to beat each other's high scores.

Oh.. and "Pukul Lalat" is a phrase in Indonesian, meaning "swatting flies".

A little bit about me: I am Jonas Wagner, a computer science researcher,
traveller, avid book reader, guitar player, boyscout. Here's [my blog][blog],
where I sometimes write about these activities.
