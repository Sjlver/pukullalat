Pukul Lalat
===========

Pukul Lalat is *the* electronic game of my youth. My family received it from a
friend when I was five years old. We had intense competitions in our household,
as everybody tried to beat each other's high scores.

Oh... and "Pukul Lalat" is a phrase in Indonesian, meaning "swatting flies".
